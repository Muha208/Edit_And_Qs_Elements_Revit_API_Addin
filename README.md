Addin Concept:
As a technical office Engineer, Special In Qs Of elements I need to get the length of each line to gets the Parameter, get Area the get the height Of length to get the Volume According to that we faced Some Problems:
- At the first from original schedule View Without any additional calculations, We can Get this.
- Here we get (Height -  Volume) And We can get  the Area from Material Take-off but It will give us Total Faces Area Not The Planner Face only.
- And What is that? There is no information here, So Why? Because the modeler draw this column 
Using “Model In-Place” it’s something which as Mass with material and we call it Structural Column.
- We need to get all planner shape lines to put in Qs schedule To Explain how we get this parameter.
- Here In ”Length” Column We Can Get The Hight But This Not The Clear Height!.
- We need to get the column's location grids to Get something like that  “C1” At Axis “L-1”,So we
Need to Know the Grids That’s Columns Intersected With.
